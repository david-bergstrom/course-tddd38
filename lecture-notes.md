Eric Elfving - Advanced programming in C++

# Overview

The course covers the standard library, standard template library (STL) and
writing your own templates.

A self study course. One lecture and several seminars. Each seminar is given
twice in order to avoid scheduling problems. It is preferred if you are
prepared.

Gitlab page for the course, could be useful for keeping track of updates.

The labs are non-examining and the examinator will try to attend the most of
them.

There are excersises which can be done and handed in if you want feedback.

The course might cover some of the new stuff in C++1y (2017).

# The examination

Computer examination - five hours.

You have to use the advanced stuff to get points. Avoid the C-style if there is a modern version in C++03, 11, 14, 17 etc.

Access to the reference part of cppreference.com and access to the instructions for using the exam systems, currently given on the course page.

# Litterature

Up to you!

Noticable examples:

* C++ primer
* Effective Modern C++, 2014

# Language Design Rules

Leave no room for a lower-level language below C++.

What you don't use, you don't pay for (zero-overhead rule).

# Two very important terms

Implementation defined

Undefined Behavior
